          Mathilda, a twelve-year old New York girl, is living an undesirable
          life among her half-family. Her father stores drugs for two-faced cop
          Norman Stansfield. Only her little brother keeps Mathilda from
          breaking apart. One day, Stansfield and his team take cruel revenge on
          her father for stretching the drugs a little, thus killing the whole
          family. Only Mathilda, who was out shopping, survives by finding
          shelter in Léon's apartment in the moment of highest need. Soon, she
          finds out about the strange neighbour's unusual profession - killing -
          and desperately seeks his help in taking revenge for her little
          brother. Léon, who is completely unexperienced in fatherly tasks, and
          in friendships, does his best to keep Mathilda out of trouble -
          unsuccessfully. Now, the conflict between a killer, who slowly
          discovers his abilities to live, to feel, to love and a corrupt police
          officer, who does anything in his might to get rid of an eye witness,
          arises to unmeasurable proportions - all for the sake of a little
          twelve-year old girl, who has nearly nothing to lose.

          Gary Oldman is a talented English movie star and character actor,
          renowned for his expressive acting style. One of the most celebrated
          thespians of his generation, with a diverse career encompassing
          theatre, film and television, he is known for his roles as Sid Vicious
          in Sid and Nancy (1986), Drexl in True Romance (1993), George Smiley
          in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011), and Winston Churchill in Darkest
          Hour (2017), among many others. For much of his career, he was
          best-known for playing over-the-top antagonists, such as terrorist
          Egor Korshunov in the 1997 blockbuster Air Force One (1997), though he
          has reached a new audience with heroic roles in the Harry Potter and
          Dark Knight franchises. He is also a filmmaker, musician, and author.
          Gary Leonard Oldman was born on March 21, 1958 in New Cross, London,
          England, to Kathleen (Cheriton), a homemaker, and Leonard Bertram
          Oldman, a welder. He won a scholarship to Britain's Rose Bruford Drama
          College, in Sidcup, Kent, where he received a B.A. in theatre arts in
          1979. He subsequently studied with the Greenwich Young People's
          Theatre and went on to appear in a number of plays throughout the
          early '80s, including "The Pope's Wedding," for which he received Time
          Out's Fringe Award for Best Newcomer of 1985-1986 and the British
          Theatre Association's Drama Magazine Award as Best Actor for 1985.
          Before fame, he was employed as a worker in assembly lines, and as a
          porter in an operating theater. He also got jobs selling shoes and
          beheading pigs while supporting his early acting career. His film
          debut was Remembrance (1982), though his most-memorable early role
          came when he played Sex Pistol Sid Vicious in the biopic Sid and Nancy
          (1986) picking up the Evening Standard Film Award as Best Newcomer. He
          then received a Best Actor nomination from BAFTA for his portrayal of
          '60s playwright Joe Orton in Prick Up Your Ears (1987). In the 1990s,
          Oldman brought to life a series of iconic real-world and fictional
          villains including Lee Harvey Oswald in JFK (1991), the title
          character in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), Drexl Spivey in True
          Romance (1993), Stansfield in Léon: The Professional (1994),
          Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg in The Fifth Element (1997) and Ivan
          Korshunov in Air Force One (1997). That decade also saw Oldman
          portraying Ludwig van Beethoven in biopic Immortal Beloved (1994).
          Oldman played the coveted role of Sirius Black in Harry Potter and the
          Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), giving him a key part in one of the
          highest-grossing franchises ever. He reprised that role in Harry
          Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) and Harry Potter and the Order of
          the Phoenix (2007). Oldman also took on the iconic role of Detective
          James Gordon in writer-director Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins
          (2005), a role he played again in The Dark Knight (2008) and The Dark
          Knight Rises (2012). Prominent film critic Mark Kermode, in reviewing
          The Dark Knight, wrote, "the best performance in the film, by a mile,
          is Gary Oldman's ... it would be lovely to see him get a[n Academy
          Award] nomination because actually, he's the guy who gets kind of
          overlooked in all of this." Oldman co-starred with Jim Carrey in the
          2009 version of A Christmas Carol in which Oldman played three roles.
          He had a starring role in David Goyer's supernatural thriller The
          Unborn, released in 2009. In 2010, Oldman co-starred with Denzel
          Washington in The Book of Eli. He also played a lead role in Catherine
          Hardwicke's Red Riding Hood. Oldman voiced the role of villain Lord
          Shen and was nominated for an Annie Award for his performance in Kung
          Fu Panda 2. In 2011, Oldman portrayed master spy George Smiley in the
          adaptation of John le Carré's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011), and
          the role scored Oldman his first Academy Award nomination. In 2014, he
          played one of the lead humans in the science fiction action film Dawn
          of the Planet of the Apes (2014). Also in 2014, Oldman starred
          alongside Joel Kinnaman, Abbie Cornish, Michael Keaton, and Samuel L.
          Jackson in the remake of RoboCop (2014), as Norton, the scientist who
          creates RoboCop. Also that year, Oldman starred in Dawn of the Planet
          of the Apes as one of the leads alongside Jason Clarke and Keri
          Russell. Aside from acting, Oldman tried his hand at writing and
          directing for Nil by Mouth (1997). The movie opened the Cannes Film
          Festival in 1997, and won Kathy Burke a Best Actress prize at the
          festival. Oldman has three children, Alfie, with first wife, actress
          Lesley Manville, and Gulliver and Charlie with his third wife, Donya
          Fiorentino. In 2017, he married writer and art curator Gisele Schmidt.
          In 2018 he won an Oscar for best actor for his work on Darkest Hour
          (2017).

          Natalie Portman is the first person born in the 1980s to have won the
          Academy Award for Best Actress (for Black Swan (2010)). Natalie was
          born Natalie Hershlag on June 9, 1981, in Jerusalem, Israel. She is
          the only child of Avner Hershlag, a Israeli-born doctor, and Shelley
          Stevens, an American-born artist (from Cincinnati, Ohio), who also
          acts as Natalie's agent. Her parents are both of Ashkenazi Jewish
          descent. Natalie's family left Israel for Washington, D.C., when she
          was still very young. After a few more moves, her family finally
          settled in New York, where she still lives to this day. She graduated
          with honors, and her academic achievements allowed her to attend
          Harvard University. She was discovered by an agent in a pizza parlor
          at the age of 11. She was pushed towards a career in modeling but she
          decided that she would rather pursue a career in acting. She was
          featured in many live performances, but she made her powerful film
          debut in the movie Léon: The Professional (1994) (aka "Léon").
          Following this role Natalie won roles in such films as Heat (1995),
          Beautiful Girls (1996), and Mars Attacks! (1996). It was not until
          1999 that Natalie received worldwide fame as Queen Amidala in the
          highly anticipated US$431 million-grossing prequel Star Wars: Episode
          I - The Phantom Menace (1999). She then she starred in two critically
          acclaimed comedy dramas, Anywhere But Here (1999) and Where the Heart
          Is (2000), followed by Closer (2004), for which she received an Oscar
          nomination. She reprised her role as Padme Amidala in the last two
          episodes of the Star Wars prequel trilogy: Star Wars: Episode II -
          Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of
          the Sith (2005). She received an Academy Award and a Golden Globe
          Award for Best Actress in Black Swan (2010). She received a second
          nomination for Best Actress, for playing Jacqueline Kennedy in Jackie
          (2016).
